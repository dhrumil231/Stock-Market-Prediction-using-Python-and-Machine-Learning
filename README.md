# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Python-and-Machine-Learning

Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to create the framework to efficiently predict future stock prices using historical financial data in Python. In the finance sector, the ability to predict price movements of specific stocks is critical for providing insights to investors and analysts. By creating a tool that can accurately predict stock price movements, both individuals and large organizations focusing on wealth management can make informed decisions using data analysis to optimize investment strategies and mitigate risk. 
Approach 
This project utilizes Python to perform stock price prediction, leveraging historical financial data and various machine learning models. The function involves collecting daily stock data from Yahoo! Finance, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing for modeling. Three time series models are used; ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet. These models are trained on past stock prices, macroeconomic indicators, and financial indicators to make accurate predictions about the short term outlook of a given stock. The goal is to predict stock prices for future periods and allow the user to make decisions on which model to use, based on error metrics. The function is designed to not need any machine learning experience to make predictions. Six hand-selected stocks from different sectors will be used to show how the different modeling approaches work.
